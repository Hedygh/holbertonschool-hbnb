# HBnB Evolution

HBnB Evolution is a simplified AirBnB-like application designed to demonstrate software architecture, object-oriented design, and full-stack development principles.  

The project is structured in multiple phases, progressively moving from system design and modeling to implementation and persistence. It emphasizes clean architecture, separation of concerns, and maintainable code organization.

## Part 1 – UML Design

Part 1 focuses on the architectural and conceptual design of the system using UML diagrams.

This phase includes:

- A **High-Level Package Diagram** describing the layered architecture.
- A **Detailed Class Diagram** defining the core business entities.
- **Sequence Diagrams** illustrating how API calls interact across system layers.

The purpose of this phase is to establish a clear technical blueprint that will guide the implementation stages of the HBnB Evolution project.
